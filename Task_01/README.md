# 🧠 AIDD 30-Day Challenge - Task 01

## Reflection Answers
### Q1: What AI-Driven Development means to me
To me, AI-Driven Development is an era where the AI is not just here to help us during development, from providing code sinppets to make us understand what the error is, it has now become our active assistant throughout the development process - means that now we can focus more on thinking, planning and evaluating rather than just writing code. Earlier, developers write every line of code by themselve but from now AI generates code and developer work as a orchestrator to guide and improve it

⭐In Short:

**AIDD means I spend less time typing code and more time thinking like an architect, strategist, and domain expert.**

### Q2: How do you see the future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development
I see the future of Human-AI Collaboration in software development as a true partnership, where **Humans will become architects, strategists, and supervisors, while AI becomes the builder, maintainer, and executor.**    
AI will handle to write most of the code(including debugging and testing), Refactoring large codebases, Understanding entire repositories, Maintaining and updating old systems, Generating documentation and Performing repetitive or mechanical work while Humans will focus on Architecture and system design, Understanding business needs, Making ethical and strategic decisions, Reviewing and validating AI-generated work, Creative problem-solving and innovation

Humans will guide, design, and judge —
AI will code, test, optimize, and maintain.
